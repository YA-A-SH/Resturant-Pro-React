# 🍽️ Restaurant Management Web Application With Admin Dashboard (React)
## 📌 Overview

This project is a full-featured Restaurant Management Web Application built with React, designed to simulate a real-world restaurant system with a strong focus on clean code, scalable architecture, performance optimization, and user experience.

## 🌍 Multilingual Experience (i18n & Localization)

The application supports both **English and Arabic**, implemented using **i18n** with a clear focus on *localization*, not literal translation.

Each language version was crafted as a **standalone experience**, ensuring that:
- The Arabic version is not a word-by-word translation.
- Content tone, expressions, and UX copy are culturally adapted.
- Users feel the application was originally designed in their language.

This approach resulted in:
- 5,000+ localized content entries
- Unique phrasing, storytelling, and emotional tone per language
- A more natural and immersive experience for both English and Arabic users

Language switching is seamless and applied across:
- User-facing pages
- Admin Dashboard
- Notifications, alerts, and system messages

## 🧠 Architecture & Code Quality

Clean, maintainable, and scalable codebase

Applied Container / Presenter pattern

Performance optimizations using:

useMemo

useCallback

React.memo

useRef

Lazy loading with React.lazy and Suspense

Functional state updates to avoid stale state

Proper cleanup in useEffect to prevent memory leaks

State management using Redux Toolkit (RTK)

## ⚠️ Challenges & Solutions
API Limitations

No single free API provided meals, drinks, and desserts

Solution: Integrated three different APIs

Pricing & Rating

Values generated temporarily

Initialized once inside useEffect to prevent changes on re-render

Favorites Synchronization

Solved using LocalStorage

## 🎯 Project Purpose

This project was built as a practical showcase of my development mindset, focusing on application structure, real-world problem solving, and performance optimization.

Over approximately one month of development, multiple challenges were identified and resolved, turning complex requirements into a solid and reusable workflow.

# 🤖 AI-Assisted Enhancements

AI-assisted tools were selectively used to support design decisions and improve the overall user interface and user experience in specific parts of the application.
